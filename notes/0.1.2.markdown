# fixes

* defining multiple benchmarks now works as expected

Previously if you defined benchmarks in multiple source files cappi would attempt to run them as a comma-separated list which did not work.
Instead cappy no opts to run these as sequentially forked tasks.

# enhancements

* Passing Caliper flags to benchmark tests

Caliper allows you to pass along flags to customize test runs but cappi did not expose an interface to do so. You can do so now by defining a `cappiSettings`binding. 

In your build definition you can do this using the [cappi.Opts]() helper.

    cappi.Keys.caliperOptions in cappi.Keys.cappi :=
      cappi.Opts.params(("foo", "bar"), ("baz" -> "boom"))
